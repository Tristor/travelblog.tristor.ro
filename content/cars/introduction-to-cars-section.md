This is the first post in a new section being added to my website.  Starting in late 2017, I finally got to a point in my life where I could go all-in on a long-time interest of mine: motorsports.  On December 21st, 2017, I purchased new a 2017 Subaru BRZ Limited, and had it on a race track getting instruction before the paper plates were off.  I haven't slowed down much since, and now have a membership at Harris Hill Raceway in San Marcos, Texas, a local club track, where I try to visit at least twice a month.

I've largely been sharing photos and notes of my progress via the FT86 Club Forums and via Facebook, where I moderate several of the FRS/BRZ/86 related car groups. Now I'm making an effort to expand my personal website to help me get off of Facebook entirely.  This section is an attempt to share with the world the things I've learned and to form a repository of knowledge I can refer to later.  My intention is to share information about equipment, techniques, event results, DIY guides, advice, and just "talk shop".

My hope is that this will become a useful resource for others, not just for myself.  So hop aboard as I populate this section with several articles in the coming months.
