## Where Have I Been?

It's been awhile since I've last written anything here and I apologize for that.  I've had a few people ask me when I was going to post something again.  The truth is, I've been spending a lot of time working. When I haven't been working I've been reading and sometimes thinking, although reading quite a bit more than thinking.  I've thought a lot about the experiences I've been having on my journey and what it means to me as a person, what it means to us as a group.  Long story short though, I haven't found it in myself to put much of these thoughts down and share them with the world.  Today's post will be short and to the point, but hopefully will reassure my readers that I haven't completely disappeared from this Earth yet.

Since I last posted I've done a handful of things:

* Spent 5 days road-tripping through the Serbian countryside and visited the Uvac Special Nature Reserve where I met some great people and hiked to see the Griffin Vultures.
* Traveled to London, UK and spent a month living there in a new coliving concept called The Collective
* Visited Sarah Van Der Veken, an online friend who is also a former coworker of mine at Rackspace.  Got to meet Sarah's wonderful fiance Myf and had a lovely time with both of them in Reading and Avebury.
* Traveled back to Prague twice for short weekend trips
* Traveled to Lisbon, Portugal where I'm currently living with the RY Darien group.
* Visited Porto, Portugal over the 3-day Labor Day weekend during which I met a handful of other travelers, visited some of the great Port wine lodges, toured a Port cellar, and saw some awesome street art.
* Eaten a lot of pastries and ice cream.
* Drank an absurd amount of espresso
* Had 25 Full English Breakfasts in 30 days.


## On Quiet and Loudness

I've touched on my social anxiety and general social ineptitude a bit in previous posts, but I wanted to discuss another aspect of it that I've been giving some matter of thought lately.  If you were to ask most people I've known in my life if they thought I was a loud person, they'd probably tell you that I talk too much.  In fact, I've heard that as an almost constant refrain in my life. For the short periods of time that people interact with me its also most likely true.  See, the thing about me that very few people have ever grasped is that for me social interaction is a rather staccato affair.  Perfectly comfortable in silence and solitude, I can sometimes go weeks (or even months if people let me) without having any interaction deeper than the basic politeness necessary when purchasing a sandwich or a drink at the corner store.  Within that time you'll find me neck deep in reading material, work, writing, and music, without any real desire for conversation.  Once a conversation occurs though and I've decided to put the energy in that it takes to pursue social interaction its almost as if all that energy wants to leave me at once.  It's a difficult matter to contain, and one that I've struggled with for all of my life.

This behavioural quirk of mine certainly has made an impact in my relationships with others, rarely positive.  Despite that, it's something I still find difficulty controlling.  Every once in awhile though I meet a kindred soul who has a similar quirk.  One of my closest and longest friends I see perhaps once a year at most, but upon each meeting we converse voluminously and loquaciously for hours, until again we drift apart to meet again many months later.  For most people though they find my conversational style offputting either due to the quantity or the intensity of the energy I put forth in such a short time span.  Thus, most people have this deep-seated impression of me that I "talk too much" or that I'm "loud", although if you were to ask me I consider myself a rather quiet person in general.

I bring up this about myself not to defend it, but more as an object lesson in which I find that perception is so deeply important to social interactions and meeting people.  Someone once told me that "perception is reality", and so it is.  If you have interacted with me for only a few spans of time over the years you might easily form the perception I talk too much simply because of repeated impressions of that fact.  Meanwhile, since I spend every waking moment with myself, I alone have experienced the countless hours sitting in a quiet room reading a book, walking down an empty tree-lined path with my camera, or finding a bench in a city to watch people and pidgeons pass by.  Thus our differing experiences cause us to form different perceptions, both of which are true and neither one more valid than the other.  I struggle to gain understanding of other's perceptions about myself and how my behavior forms those perceptions, even in the minutest actions.  This in many ways is the basis of my social ineptitude.

Of all the time I spend alone, probably the majority of it is spent thinking about past social situations and what I could have done better.  I've never quite decided if my withering self-reflection is caused by my social anxiety, a cause of my social anxiety, or completely ancillary.  In any case, I have no harsher critic for my actions than myself, as despite being terrible at perceiving social signals in the moment I analyze all of my interactions with the ruthless clarity of hindsight and a nagging desire to improve myself.  At least for the past few weeks almost all of that self-reflection has been focused on the question fo "How much is too much?" or perhaps "How much is enough?".  I haven't really come to an answer yet, but I wanted to open a window into my mind for those who have been generous enough with their time to spend it reading the things I've written here.  I don't doubt many other people struggle with similar questions, if not the same question.

## A Poem for Pastéis de Nata

As I gaze upon your face my heart blooms
The smell of you is subtle spice and sweetness
Inky blackness stands out from you like eyes to see
Slowly, almost hesitantly I reach out and touch you
Feeling the buttery smoothness of your skin
You feel my breath as I open my mouth to taste you
Nibbling you carefully as my tongue darts inside
The flavor and heat of you is overwhelming
Leaving me almost gasping but not wanting to stop
Consuming you completely coated in cinnamon
Stopping for a moment of reflection
Mingling the lingering taste of you with the bitter of café
Impossible to satisfy my urge with only one
Without regret I reach for another
