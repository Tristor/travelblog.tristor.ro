## Why Am I in Valencia, Spain Instead of Rabat, Morocco?

Well, the long story short is that when we left Lisbon I had a respiratory illness.  It continued to worsen in Morocco in part due to the poor air quality there.  Along with this, the Internet connectivity was not very good in Morocco so it meant I could either go to the coworking space sick to work or stay home sick and do nothing.  Ultimately, I ended up being out of work for several weeks and eventually had to leave the country on advisement of a local doctor.

As a parting gift and a bit TMI, but my last day in Morocco (or on my flight leaving) I acquired traveler's diarrhea, which necessitated me taking antibiotics that I later found out cause an unpleasant neurological side effect.  I'm now well from the TD, but still suffering from lingering respiratory issues which are much improved with the better air quality in Valencia.

Sad to say, I was unable to participate in any camel related activities within or without the group, so there will be no selfies of me with a camel.  No one is more sorry than I am that I don't have the sweetest profile photo for Tinder ever doing a camel head-tilt.

With that out of the way...

## Photo Gallery

I've added a photo gallery component to my site in order to make it easier for me to post photos without necessarily needing to write a post to go with it.  Now you can see my latest photos during my travels in a simple, high-quality way without me needing to rely on any third-party services or put a significant amount of effort into organization and metadata generation.
