### Introduction

I've been making an attempt to keep my politics and to some extent philosophy out of my writing here.  Part of that is due to an unfortunately reasonable fear of backlash, considering the current political climate.  Part of it is because I try not to proselytize, only converse.  I have far more respect for someone who disagrees with me but is of strong character than someone who agrees with me but is of weak character, so in that regard I have no serious desire to convert others to my own system of belief.  Considering my system of belief can be best summed up as "you do you", that should come as no surprise.

That said, since my return from my travels I've gained a new perspective on my experiences in the past and have noticed some things that were hidden to me before.  Much of this has to do with some of the experiences I've had trying to meet new people, date, and generally get along with people in my age group here in the US and how that sharply contrasts with my experiences in the rest of the world.  Some of it has to do with some realizations I've had about myself and how I came to be who I am today.  I honestly don't know that the structure I have going on here will be cohesive and intuitive, because it's mostly a thoughtstream at the moment.

### A Primer in Basic Philosophy: Individualism vs Collectivism

### What is an Individual?

### What's in a Name?

Our names are identifiers.  They're a way to refer to ourselves.  

### Can Capitalism be Collectivist?

### Selfishness or Emotional Maturity?

### Labels vs Values

As you can probably tell from my narrative above, one of the realizations I've made is that people in my age group tend to define themselves by labels.  If you ask most Millennials "Who are you?" they'll provide you a list of labels as identifiers.  We define ourselves by the clothes we wear, the phone we carry, which text editor we use, whether we use Facebook or we don't, what sports team we root for, which politicians we vote for, or things that are more obvious like our gender and skin color.  Some of us who are on the older side of the generation might define ourselves by the car we drive or the type of work that we do.  This tends to miss the rather important point however.  Labels are what you are, not who you are.  Who we are is defined by our values.  Labels can sometimes be a poor substitute for a collection of values, such as political party affiliations implying a particular set of values, but they're not one and the same.

Values are more deep seated than labels, they're something which form a foundation for your entire world view.  They act as a way to center yourself when you encounter a new situation and are unsure of your direction.  Lacking values of your own, not knowing who you are, can lead you to feel disconnected from the world around you, or worse overwhelmed and unable to fit in.  I've been there myself, feelings of inadequacy because I didn't fit in with my peer group and I didn't understand why.  Much later I realized it was because the labels were revered more than the values, the ability to fit in was based on superficial things, some of which are unchangeable about you as a person like what color the skin you were born with happens to be.

A simple way to think about this is that labels are the things other people might use to describe us, values are what we use to define ourselves.  Knowing yourself is about knowing what values you hold true.  The example below should be illustrative of what I mean by this contrast.

##### What Am I?

Now or at some time in the past all of these labels have been true about me.

White, Straight, Male, Fat, Average Size, Strong, Weak, Fast, Talkative, Shy, Mean, Generous, Geek, Gentleman, Poor, Middle Class, Poorly Dressed, Well Dressed, Victim, Fighter, Engineer, Management, Cashier, Stockboy, Consultant, Contractor, and Student

##### Who Am I?

I define myself by the following values, although I may not always live up to them fully even in my own eyes.

* Accountability
* Decency
* Civility
* Integrity
* Respect

How I define what each of these means and why I consider it a core part of who I am is a deeper, longer, more personal story than this post.  Perhaps I'll share it some time.

### Conclusion
