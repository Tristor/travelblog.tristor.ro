### Introduction

I've been giving a lot of thought to this topic lately, although I'm still not exactly sure how to approach it.  This post is a bit of a departure from the other things I've written lately to be less fact, more opinion and observation.

In my career I've met many different engineers, lots of them were brilliant at their job.  However, one recurring theme that I encountered, even within myself, was a desire to always be right.  This manifests differently for different people, but in the end I think is brought about partly by an upbringing where being right is rewarded and partly by a business culture where engineers are looked to for solutions no matter what the issue may be.

The bare truth is that an attitude of feeling like you always have to be right is often driven by insecurity.  The pressure to perform and to have an answer for every happenstance occurrence is very strong in engineering culture and can have a detrimental impact on both personality and behavior.  I feel like in some ways why there's a stereotype of a grumpy or know-it-all older engineer is because of changes to your personality that come directly from the job (or perhaps the job attracts those personalities).  I don't think it has to be this way though, and I hope this attempt to analyze the behavior I've observed and sometimes done myself will help others to find a way out.


### Behavioral Breakdown

Always Right:

* first to answer
* alienates others
* close minded, insists their way is the only way
* driven by insecurity or fear (imposter syndrome?)
* adversarial relationship with management in the business
* points fingers/deflects blame or responsibility


Rarely Wrong:

* can say "I don't know", knows this is an acceptable answer
* takes responsibility for outcomes
* open minded/always learning
* thinks before speaking
* driven by responsibility and acceptance
* collaborative relationship with management in the business
* is clear about the possibilities
