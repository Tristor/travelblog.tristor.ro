# Introduction

I'm nearing the end of my Remote Year experience.  I've also now done several solo or small-group sidetrips away from the larger program.  In the last ten months, I've had numerous interesting experiences that have expanded by horizons, opened my mind to different cultures and different ways of life, and ultimately it has helped me grow as a person.  It's been a wonderful experience all around for that reason.  Despite this, there are many parts to traveling which I think people don't talk about much.  When people tend to point out the downsides to traveling for an extended period of time they talk about important things, but things which are if not easy to talk about, perhaps at least socially acceptable to bring up.  My experiences on my journey have opened my mind to a few realities of the world that I may have intellectually understood but never really grokked until now.  In this article I'm going to just focus on the three that are most pressing on my mind at the moment as I'm writing this.


# 1. It's Really Hard to Take Care of Your Body

I applaud the people in my group who consistently run, TRX, or go to a gym and have maintained healthy diets.  On the other hand, I have found that I lack the energy or motivation to do so because I am constantly bombarded by the emotions involved in my new experience.  As someone suffering from social anxiety and who is generally introverted besides, just the reality of being in a new city, dealing with a new language, in new accomodations, with new room-mates drains my motivation to do anything but get work done, absorb my surroundings, and try to introspect.  Besides this, since you don't have access to your primary care physician or the same sort of relationship with local healthcare professionals that you have back home seeking out treatment for anything which isn't immediately an issue is pretty much a non-starter.

Most of the people in my group have made it through these last ten months without much in the way of health issues.  All in all, I think we started the year as a remarkably healthy group in general for being pulled from many different backgrounds and cities.  Probably more than anyone I've experienced weird health issues during my travels.  Part of this is because of my general penchant for finding myself in strange situations and part if it is directly caused by my underlying health issues (GERD, anxiety, and asthma) which excacerbate or cause other conditions.
