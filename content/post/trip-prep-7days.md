This is going to be short, just a quick update on how things are going.

##### Illness Update

The medication I am taking has caused some bad side effects.  I'll spare the details, but I think I may have it under control.  I am following up on Monday with the ENT specialist to check everything out, and then I am going to get my Hepatitis B booster this week assuming I am safe to do so.  My illness hopefully is coming to an end, because I'm about to hop on a plane.

##### Saying Good-Bye

I had a little get-together last night to say good-bye.  Unfortunately due to my illness I wasn't really able to partake, but I did open up several of the beers I'd brewed as well as rare beers of various kinds I'd collected and cellared over the years.  I think everyone had a good time, and I got to see pretty much everyone before I left.  Absolutely wanted to make sure I left with no regrets and had a chance to see everybody, some who hadn't really seen me much since my return from Colorado at the beginning of the year.

#####  Baggage Update

Bags have been packed initially, but I am going to have to figure some things out.  My carry-on #2 is about 1.7 pounds over weight, and my checked baggage is 8 pounds over weight. I can probably chance it with the carry-on bag, but the checked bag I'm definitely going to have to trim down.  I'm thinking I'll have to ditch my cowboy boots and long socks, and a few pairs of jeans, plus some of the nice-to-haves to make it fit.  Not the end of the world, but regretful since I was hoping I could get the boots on the trip.

###### Updated #2

I ditched 2 undershirts, 1 long-sleeve shirt, 1 golf shirt, 2 pairs of jeans, some of my toiletries, all the boot-length socks, and my cowboy boots.  I'll now be wearing the XR Mission shoes so I only had to pack one pair in the suitcase.  This got me from 58 pounds to 48.7 pounds for my checked bag.  I'll have to buy some toiletries when I get to Prague, but otherwise it should be fine.  When I repacked I also worked on balancing the weight in the bag a little better as well, which may have had an effect when weighing using the hand-held luggage scale.  I won't be cutting any weight on my carry-on for the trip to Prague, but may do so before I board the bus.
