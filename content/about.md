## About Me

I am many things, but perhaps most of all I am a life-long learner.  I aspire to become a renaissance man, although I see the journey ahead as being long (and a whole lot of fun).  My interests are fairly broad, and I tend to pick up new hobbies and interests often, delve deeply into them, and then file them away to make room for the next.


My primary focus right now, besides travel, is my love of food, drink (coffee, beer, and whisk(e)y), photography, and technology.  These are the topics which primarily be the focus of my writing. I'm going to attempt to make at least weekly updates to this site, especially during my travels.  I am, unfortunately, also a workaholic though, so this will require some discipline on my part.

### Travel

I'm currently one of the folks in the June 2016 cohort for [Remote Year](http://www.remoteyear.com/).  In short, I'm doing a lot of international travel currently.  I've attempted a blog a few times before, but traveling this much has given me a great reason to write and share.  I would not say I'm any sort of expert on travel, but I'll share any of my experiences, tips and tricks, etc. along the way.

### DevOps Engineer

I first started using computers when I was a small child, with help from my father.  I learned QBASIC on DOS, later started learning C, and fell in love with building computers out of parts and overclocking. This early exposure taught me how to deconstruct systems logically and helped me better understand both security implications and what the hidden effects of a design choice might be.  I like to gain understanding about systems and software, but find that I do so better by deconstructing them than writing them.  Perhaps because of this, I've found that while I am capable of doing so I don't much care for writing software, although I do write software from time to time when necessary.  Currently, if I do have to write software I most enjoy doing it using [Google Golang](http://golang.org/)

### Photographer

My dad got me into photography when I was young.  He was a pretty good wildlife photographer and often entered his photos into contests at the county fair, winning several blue ribbons in the process.  He still has all of his old Minolta 35mm gear.  These days I too primarily focus on wildlife and nature photography, although I'm a rank amateur at best. It's a hobby I picked back up within the last couple of years during my extended stay in Colorado hiking in the mountains and drinking beer.  It turns out there's something almost meditative for me about photography. It also helps provide extra incentive to get out and hike which is great for my health.

These days I take a lot of photos but am very bad about handling post-processing.  I don't do a whole lot during post-processing, but I do shoot in RAW exclusively which means I have to at least color correct, lens correct, and crop.  I have a pretty huge backlog I need to get through at all times, but am making an effort to be timely with photos while traveling to accompanying my writing here.

### Beer

I would say I'm probably obsessed a bit with beer.  I spent more than a year in Colorado for the primary purpose of trying a bunch of breweries (I visited more than 130 while there), and in the process learned how to home-brew and went to many beer festivals.  That's just a small fraction of the lengths I've went to in order to try new and interesting brews. I've tasted many thousands of beers from all over the world at this point, and I look forward to trying many more.  Always happy to share a pint and have a conversation about beer.
