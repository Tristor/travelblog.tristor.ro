# Talk Outline

1. Talk Series Format/Setup
2. Why Nginx?
3. Wordpress Prerequisites
4. Set Up Your VM
5. Demo Time
6. Conclusion / Things to Explore

##### Please Hold Questions Until The End!
---

# Talk Series Format/Setup

* I plan to have multiple parts to this topic in a series of talks
* This presentation assumes for the purposes of demonstration that you'll be working within a local VM inside Vagrant w/ the Linux distribution of your choice.
* To follow along it is required to have a laptop with Vagrant and VirtualBox installed (both free)

### If you didn't previously setup Vagrant and VirtualBox do so now please

---

# Why Nginx?

* Architected to do one simple function as fast as possible (serve sockets)
* Flexible, but not by including the kitchen sink (compile-in modules)
* For all intents and purposes, is the fastest performing web server
* Easy to understand configuration which is declarative
* Sane defaults
* Constantly improving

---

# Wordpress Prerequisites
For the purposes of this presentation we'll be installing Wordpress.  Wordpress requires the following:

* A web server - Nginx
* A database server - Percona
* PHP 5 or later - PHP-FPM

We'll additionally need some prerequisites for doing the more advanced portion of the demo:

* A TLS library - OpenSSL [:(]

---

# Set Up Your VM

* First, create a new Vagrant VM by making a new folder on your system and using `vagrant init`
* Install Wordpress Prerequisites, for the purpose of this demo I will be using Debian 8
  - Nginx: https://nginx.org/en/linux_packages.html#mainline
  - Percona: https://www.percona.com/downloads/Percona-Server-5.7/LATEST/
  - PHP-FPM: `apt-get install php5-fpm php5-mcrypt php5-mysqlnd php5-curl php5-mbstring php5-imagick`
  - OpenSSL: `apt-get install openssl openssl-dev`
* A Good DHParam and Self-Signed Certificate: https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-create-a-self-signed-ssl-certificate-for-nginx-in-ubuntu-16-04
* SSL Configuration: https://mozilla.github.io/server-side-tls/ssl-config-generator/?server=nginx-1.10.1&openssl=1.0.1e&hsts=yes&profile=modern

# Set Up Your VM, Cont.

* Wordpress Install: https://codex.wordpress.org/Installing_WordPress
* Download Wordpress: https://wordpress.org/download/
* Simple Guide to Install Wordpress: https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-wordpress-on-centos-7
* Tune PHP-FPM:
  - php.ini
    * cgi.fix_pathinfo=0
  - www.conf:
    * pm.min_spare_servers = 1
    * pm.max_spare_servers = 3
    * pm.start_servers = 2
    * pm.max_children = 5
* Configure Nginx

# Demo Time!

# Conclusion

* Wordpress is a popular content management and blogging platform
* It's a fairly simple matter to install Wordpress on your own Linux server
* Nginx + PHP-FPM require minimal tuning in order to be performant
* Configuring strong TLS is pretty easy, especially with the Mozilla tools
* For $5/mo + the cost of a domain you could be rocking your own blog :)
