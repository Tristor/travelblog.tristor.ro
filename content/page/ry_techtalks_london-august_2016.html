# Talk Outline

1. Talk Series Format/Setup
2. What is the Cloud Anyway?
3. What is Linux?
4. Why Linux?
5. Getting Started with Vagrant and VirtualBox
6. Demo Time
7. Conclusion / Things to Explore

##### Please Hold Questions Until The End!

# Talk Series Format/Setup

* I plan to have multiple parts to this topic in a series of talks
* All tools I will present during this series will be compatible with Windows, OS X, and Linux
* To follow along it is required to have a laptop with Vagrant and VirtualBox installed (both free)

### If you didn't previously setup Vagrant and VirtualBox do so now please

# What is the Cloud Anyway?

* The Cloud consists of:
  - Agility
  - Elasticity
  - Multi-Tenancy
  - Location Independence
  - Automatable Controls
* Types of Cloud Services
  - IaaS: Infrastructure as a Service
    * The basic building blocks of computing at scale like servers, storage, and networking
  - PaaS: Platform as a Service
    * The services built on top of infrastructure that let you do useful things, such as
      - Identity/Access Management
      - Auto-Scaling
      - Application Provisioning

---

# What is the Cloud Anyway?

* Types of Cloud Services, cont.
  - SaaS: Software as a Service
    * Typically built on top of IaaS or PaaS
    * The consumer (or business) facing product that is being sold and used.
    * Examples:
      - GMail
      - Zendesk
      - Github
      - Slack
      - NetSuite
      - SalesForce
* Follows the "Service Layer Model"
* The snarky answer is the Cloud is just somebody else's computer

# What is Linux?

* Project began in 1991
* Originally created by Linus Torvalds, a Finnish man.
* Currently the largest open source free software project in existence with more than 9000 developers and over 500 companies involved over its lifetime
* Based off the POSIX standards which governed the various commercial UNIX operating systems during the 80s and 90s.
* Especially well suited for being run on servers
* Because it's free and open source, anyone can use it and modify it.
* Linux itself is just the OS kernel and must be combined with other software to be a functioning operating system.
* Functioning OSes based on Linux are called distros or distributions.  Examples:
  - Ubuntu
  - Debian
  - Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL)
  - CentOS
  - Gentoo
  - Arch Linux

---

# Why Linux?

* Almost all configuration of the OS itself and common software packages is done with text files which are easy to manipulate via automation tools
* The kernel itself is very fully featured so allows you to build a functional system in a small amount of space/overhead
* Has exceptional TCP/IP networking capabilities making it especially well suited for building infrastructure components
* Has strong security when implemented properly
* Is extremely reliable, allowing almost indefinite uptime barring unusual circumstances
* Is built around one of the most rigorously engineered standards for a server-focused operating system, POSIX
* Has been around long enough to be considered mature software

---

# Getting Started with Vagrant and VirtualBox

* VirtualBox is a free virtualization platform that lets you run virtual machines
  - Virtual machines are conceptually smaller computers running inside your computer with their own operating system installed
* Vagrant is a developer-focused wrapper for VirtualBox that makes it simple to manage and automate the building of virtual machines
* `vagrant init debian/jessie64` or `vagrant init centos/7`
* `vagrant up`
* `vagrant ssh`

# Conclusion

* The Cloud is just a series of abstractions layered on top of each other to make using complex systems easier
* Anyone can make use of the Cloud for everything from simple websites to very complex systems
* Linux is about flexibility and freedom
* Systems Operations is about reliability, security, and repeatability through automation

# Things to Explore

* Configuration Management Tools: *Chef*, Puppet, Salt, Ansible
* Web Servers: *Nginx*, *Caddy*, Apache, lighttpd
* Email MTAs: *Postfix*, qmail, sendmail, Exim, OpenSMTPd
* Email Post Office Services: *Dovecot*, Courier
* VPN Services: *OpenVPN*, StrongSWAN, SoftEther, Tinc
* Database Servers: *PostgreSQL*, MySQL/MariaDB/*Percona*, MongoDB, Cassandra 
* Other Services: Asterisk, OwnCloud, GitLab, Ampache/Koel/CherryMusic, Plex
